Nearly everyone is familiar with the pain of splitting a check.


Especially in a crowd, knowing who ordered what, figuring out how much each person has to pay, and keeping track of who actually paid is nearly impossible when you’re just trying to enjoy your night out! Trying to calculate these expenses is not only time-consuming but stressful, and too often the responsibility lands on one unfortunate individual to foot the bill.


Say goodbye to your confusion and frustration with our new, feature-filled bill-splitting app. No more need to worry about individual item amounts, taxes, or tips– with just a few taps, you can automatically and accurately split any bill among your friends, family, and more. We also keep a record of everyone’s transactions, so you can easily find out who has paid and who hasn’t at just a glance.

No more arguing! Hassle-free experience! Enjoy your time out! Feel like a boss! Our app has you covered!
