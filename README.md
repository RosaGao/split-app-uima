# $plit


Nearly everyone is familiar with the pain of splitting a check.


Especially in a crowd, knowing who ordered what, figuring out how much each person has to pay, and keeping track of who actually paid is nearly impossible when you’re just trying to enjoy your night out! Trying to calculate these expenses is not only time-consuming but stressful, and too often the responsibility lands on one unfortunate individual to foot the bill.
